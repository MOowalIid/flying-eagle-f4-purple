            <strong> Sizing Tips: </strong>

            These skates are true to size. Zero break-ins are required. If the skates do not come in half sizes or doubt
            your true size, then round your size up.
            Generally, choose the size of your own skates according to the number of sports shoes.
            <b> If your instep is relatively high or your feet are relatively wide, it is recommended that you choose a
                larger size of skates</b>
